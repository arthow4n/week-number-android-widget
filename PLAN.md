# Project Plan: Week Number Widget

This document outlines the plan for creating the Android Week Number Widget. I will keep this file updated as the project progresses.

This project has been updated to use a Docker-based build process to ensure a consistent environment.

## Plan

- [x] **1. Create a `Dockerfile`.** I'll create a `Dockerfile` that sets up an Android build environment.
- [x] **2. Update `setup.sh` to use Docker.** I'll modify the `setup.sh` script to build the Docker image and run the build inside a container.
- [x] **3. Update Documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`).** I'll update all the markdown files to reflect the new Docker-based build process.
- [x] **4. Run the Dockerized Build.** I'll run the new `setup.sh` to verify the entire process.
